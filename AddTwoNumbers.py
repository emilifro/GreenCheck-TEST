# Task 2 - Add two numbers 
# 
# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits 
# are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two 
# numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain 
# any leading zero, except the number 0 itself
# When finished stage the file and run GreenCheck
